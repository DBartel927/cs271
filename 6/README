Assembler Project - README

Introduction
This project is an implementation of an assembler for the Hack computer. The assembler translates assembly language programs into binary machine code that can be executed by the Hack hardware.

Files
The following files are included in the 06 directory:

main.c : The driver program that initiates the assembler.

parser.c and parser.h : Parsing and handling the instructions.

symtable.c and symtable.h : Symbol table implementation.

error.c and error.h : Error handling functions.

hack.h : Definitions and macros for the Hack machine.

Makefile : Used for compiling the program.

README : This file containing instructions for running the assembler.

Compilation
To compile the assembler, navigate to the directory containing the source files and run:

make

This will generate an executable named assembler.

Running the Assembler
The driver program for the assembler is main.c. To use the assembler, run the following command:

./assembler Prog.asm

Here, Prog.asm is the assembly file you want to assemble. The output will be a binary file named Prog.asm.hack.
